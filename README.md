## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about when to use grid and flexbox. And how to layout elements for device sizes.

### Continued development

I would like to update site with new projects and dynamically update with new projects and add my resume somewhere.
